    Against a backdrop of stunning scenery, Snowdonia is the perfect playground for an active holiday. Mountain biking, walking, climbing Snowdon or Cadair Idris, zip-lining, underground trampolining, sailing, canyoning and white water rafting â€“ there is so much on offer to keep your holiday here action-packed and fun-filled.

South Wales:
    Home to Wales' capital, Cardiff, and second city, Swansea, South Wales is great for those seeking a cosmopolitan holiday destination.
