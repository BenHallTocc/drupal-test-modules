#TOCC Map

The goal of the new 'TOCC Map' module is to produce a simpler and more 
manageable implementation of the functionality already provided by the 
existing 'TOCC Map Search' module.

A live, working example of the existing 'TOCC Map Search' module can be
found at http://www.walescottageholidays.co.uk/map-search.

A 'TOCC Map Areas' taxonomy has been created in this module with the following
fields:
* Hover Image
* Description
* Link Title
* Link
* Coordinates

The map base image can be installed using the 'Configure' screen for the module
at 'admin/config/toccmap'.
