#TOCC Tiles

The goal of the 'TOCC Tiles' module is to produce a gallery of
image 'tiles' that can populate a drupal block to then be placed on 
particular pages on our templated websites.

An individual image 'tile' consists of a background image with an overlay that
displays when you hover the mouse over the image. The overlay will feature a
title, description, and a "button" text label. Each 'tile' also needs a link
to target. An example of this kind of functionality can be found at
http://www.perfectstays.co.uk/.

A 'TOCC Tiles' taxonomy has been created in this module with the following
fields:
* Image
* Description
* Button Text
* Link
* Visible on Site
