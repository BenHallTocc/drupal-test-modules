#TOCC Tiles

The goal of the 'TOCC Tiles' module is to produce a configurable gallery of
image 'tiles' that can populate a drupal block to then be placed on 
particular pages on our templated websites.

An individual image 'tile' consists of a background image with an overlay that
displays when you hover the mouse over the image. The overlay will feature a
title, description, and a "button" text label. Each 'tile' also needs a link
to target. An example of this kind of functionality can be found at
http://www.perfectstays.co.uk/.

A 'TOCC Tiles' taxonomy has been created in this module with the following
fields:
* Image
* Description
* Button Text
* Link

The desired functionality of the gallery would be to allow the number of tiles
displayed to be configured. The user should be allowed to choose between
displaying 2, 4, 6, or 8 tiles.
