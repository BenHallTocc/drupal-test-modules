#TOCC Quote of the Day

The goal of the 'TOCC Quote of the Day' module is to produce a block that 
displays a selection of quotes.

A 'TOCC Quotes' taxonomy has been created in this module with the following
fields:
* Quote
* Quotee
* Location
* Additional Information
* Link
* Active

The block will output a quote with variables for 'Quotee', 'Location', and 
'Additional Information' but these should ideally be combined using CSS to form
a single 'Signature'.
