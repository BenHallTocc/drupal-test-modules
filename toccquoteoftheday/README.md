#TOCC Quote of the Day

The goal of the 'TOCC Quote of the Day' module is to produce a block that 
displays a randomly selected quote from a pool of quotes every day.

A 'TOCC Quotes' taxonomy has been created in this module with the following
fields:
* Quote
* Quotee
* Location
* Additional Information
* Link
* Active

The block will output a quote where it has combined the contents of the
'Quotee', 'Location', and 'Additional Information' fields into a single 
'Signature'.
